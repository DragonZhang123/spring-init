== Functional Only Sample

This sample runs with no annotation processing and no .class files shipped for condition processing. Hence it runs as a netive image with `spring.native.mode=functional`.

With Java 11: the image size=48M, RSS=60M. Compare with `spring.native.mode=default`: size=65.5M, RSS=105M (webflux-netty sample).

With Java 8: the image size=36M, RSS=37M (having additionally excluded Jackson to squeeze out an extra 1MB). Compare with `spring.native.mode=default`: size=65M, RSS=56M.
