== Functional Only Sample

This sample runs with no annotation processing and no .class files shipped for condition processing. Hence it runs as a netive image with `spring.native.mode=functional`.

With Java 8: the image size=35M, RSS=36M (exlcuding Jackson as well to squeeze out at extra 1MB). Compare with `spring.native.mode=default`: size=54M, RSS=58M.

== Building a Native Image
